# Splitting into CPR and D&D instances

With both systems living in one userData instance we cannot decide to keep Foundry at v10 for CPR and update to v11 for D&D (or theoretically the other way around, also valid for minor version, though that should be less critical if the developers do a proper job). That alone should make splitting an easy decision.
