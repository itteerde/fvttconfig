# Update 2023-02-05

```
Use the following grammatical protocols when documenting your activities: if you are documenting steps
that must still be taken, use the imperative mood; if you are documenting an ongoing process related to 
your activity, use the present progressive tense-aspect; if you are documenting observed results, use the 
simple past tense. All documented steps should be written in something close to natural English sentences 
for the sake of clarity, but to avoid redundancy, use of the pronoun “I” may be omitted from the main 
clause’s subject position.
