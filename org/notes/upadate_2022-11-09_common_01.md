# Update from Snapshot 2022-11-09

```
Use the following grammatical protocols when documenting your activities: if you are documenting steps
that must still be taken, use the imperative mood; if you are documenting an ongoing process related to 
your activity, use the present progressive tense-aspect; if you are documenting observed results, use the 
simple past tense. All documented steps should be written in something close to natural English sentences 
for the sake of clarity, but to avoid redundancy, use of the pronoun “I” may be omitted from the main 
clause’s subject position.
```


# Investigating Snapshot State

+ List and review Modules installed and active.
+ Review MidiQOL settings.
+ Compendium Folders.


# Updating Dev

1. Restore from Origin
    1. Restored Prod-origin to Prod.
    1. Copied Prod to Dev.
    1. Reset passwords on Dev.

+ Workout a SOP for stripping passwords, preferably including a restore step in order to have it for the case of another backup-update-restore cycle on Prod should we ever need to go back to that last resort operation for some major update or because needs to fix something that was broken on Prod and deciding to not restore a backup.
+ Review Issues.

## Activities Protocol

```
If there is another Dev from Prod iteration this needs to be reset or a new protocol needs to be added.
