# Test Protocoll for Snapshot 2022-11-03

1. started without major incidents
1. ATL error present `setup.js:141 [ATL] Metadata validation failed for module "ATL": The file "/styles/ATL.css" included by module ATL does not exist`
1. launching Spelljammer as GM without any errors and with only insignificant warnings. Going straight to trying to update.
1. Update
    1. Game System is current, 2.0.3.
    1. Exit FVTT. Delete ATL by deleting folder Data/modules/ATL. TODO: Given that we have a shared instance with Cyberpunk and a third system being installed this needs to be reviewed!
    1. Delete Ping Module (v.10 has its own ping and the old one isn't working anymore anyways)
    1. Updating all Modules.
1. Review
    1. Spelljammer starts fine.
    1. Hildr attacking with Enlarge Effect still does not add the Damage. Opening [Issue](https://github.com/itteerde/fvttconfig/issues/23).
